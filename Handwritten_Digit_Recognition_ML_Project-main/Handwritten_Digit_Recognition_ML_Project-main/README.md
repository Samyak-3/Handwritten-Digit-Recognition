# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition_Using_Keras
I have developed a machine learning project capable of accurately detecting digits ranging from 0 to 9, utilizing a 28x28 pixel image. The model is built upon a powerful combination of Tensorflow, Keras, Opencv (CV2), and Matplotlib libraries. This robust implementation has undergone multiple iterations, resulting in consistently high accuracy levels, approaching an impressive 97%

# Data Set used-
MNIST dataset present is Keras Lib, consisting almost 60000 training exmaples and 10000 testing examples.

# Model Explanation:
1.This neural network comprises three 'Dense' (Fully Connected) layers, with the first two layers containing 128 units each, and the last layer consisting of 10 units.
2.The first two layers employ the 'Relu' activation function, while the last layer utilizes the 'Softmax' activation function, which generates the final output.
3.During the compilation of the model, the 'Adam Optimizer' is employed with a learning rate of 0.001.
